# PostgreSQL - Asio

A Boost.Asio based client for PostgreSQL.

This is a proof-of-concept client to show that the principles and
concepts defined in [Boost.MySQL](https://github.com/anarthal/mysql-asio/)
are extensible to other SQL database systems.

This is **NOT** a full implementation, it is just a **proof of concept**!!
